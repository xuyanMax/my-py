# You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
# The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contain a single digit.
# Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
#
# You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
#
# Follow up:
# What if you cannot modify the input lists? In other words, reversing the lists is not allowed.
#
# Example:
#
# Input: (7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
# Output: 7 -> 8 -> 0 -> 7
